# bulk-login
the benefits of using this code include improved efficiency, flexibility, user-friendliness, and ease of maintenance, all of which can help users save time and effort when working with .docx files containing email and password pairs.

This code imports the required modules such as docx and requests and utilizes the concurrent.futures module to improve performance by submitting login requests in parallel. The tkinter module is used to display a popup window to prompt the user to select a .docx file to use. The selected file is then loaded using the docx module. The try_login function constructs the login payload and makes the login request using requests. The function returns a tuple of the email and the login response. The main section of the code creates a thread pool to make the login requests for each email/password pair in the document. The future.result() method is used to retrieve the result of each login request, and the results are checked for successful login attempts. If a successful login attempt is detected, the email is printed to the console.
